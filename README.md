# Seasonal Produce capsule for Bixby

Supermarkets don't always have the produce shoppers expect to be available, and shoppers may not know which fruits and vegetables are in season. Plus, manually looking up that information on a phone while navigating aisles with a basket full of groceries is inconvenient - it's easier to ask an intelligent assitant. 

The Seasonal Produce capsule for Bixby allows users based in the United States to request information about a specific item or season to help determine what produce to purchase. The capsule utilizes information from the [U.S. Department of Agriculture SNAP-Ed Seasonal Produce Guide](https://snaped.fns.usda.gov/seasonal-produce-guide).

## How it works

Open Bixby on your device and ask one of these questions (feel free to substitute a produce item or season of your choice!):

Are apples in season right now?<br>
When is celery in season?<br>
What produce is in season in the winter?<br>
What is in season?

Bixby will add the Seasonal Produce capsule and ask the provided question seamlessly. The capsule is now officially enabled.
